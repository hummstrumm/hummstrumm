You can sort the list by clicking on the column headers at the top of the list.

If you find a bug in the Humm and Strumm game, be sure to search through the
existing bugs to see if the problem you are seeing has already been entered in

above guidelines for bugs (i.e. look for already existing requests).  The only
difference between a bug report and a feature request is that a feature request
has a value of "Type-Enhancement" in the tag fields.
