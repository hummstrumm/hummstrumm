## Overview
The Humm and Strumm Engine is a Free Software 3D game engine.  While
its target is to be used in the video game Humm and Strumm, it is
general enough for many other games to use.  Its goal is to provide a
properly multithreaded, scalable engine to the FOSS community.

You can find our home page [here](http://hummstrumm.blogspot.com).

Our home page has news updates, new downloads, documentation, and
links to all parts of the project.

## Features
  * Object/Type System
  * Smart Pointers
  * Vector Math System
  * Debug Utilities -- Logging and Profiling
  * X11 and Win32 Native Windowing
  * Date/Time Utilities.

in mind, to ease the porting of it to other platforms.  However, we
don't currently have testing computers for other platforms, so any
system besides those enumerated above are not officially supported.
If you want to help out, contact us and arrange to become the official
tester for your platform.

## Bug Reports
The Humm and Strumm engine uses the Google Code issue tracking system.
Our issue tracker on our [Google Code project page][issue-tracker].
You can sort the list by clicking on the column headers at the top of
the list.

If you find a bug in the Humm and Strumm engine, be sure to search
through the existing bugs to see if the problem you are seeing has
already been entered into the bug database.  If you find that an entry
already exists for the bug you are seeing, do not enter it again.

To enter in a new bug you will also be required to have a Google
account.  Fill out the template, and be sure to tag the issue
appropriately using the input boxes below the main entry box.

## Feature Requests
The Google Code issue tracker is also used for new feature requests.
Use the above guidelines for bugs (i.e., look for already existing
requests).  The only difference between a bug report and a feature
request is that a feature request has a value of `Type-Enhancement` in
the tag fields.
