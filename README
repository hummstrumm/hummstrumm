== Bug Reports ==

The Humm and  Strumm game uses the Google  Code issue tracking system.
You       can       find        the       issue       tracker       at
<http://code.google.com/p/hummstrumm/issues/list>.  You  can  sort the
list by clicking on the column headers at the top of the list.

If you  find a  bug in  the  Humm and  Strumm game, be sure  to search
through the  existing bugs to  see if the  problem you are  seeing has
already been entered into the bug database.  If you find that an entry
already exists for the bug you are seeing, do not enter it again.

To enter  in a  new bug  you will also  be required  to have  a Google
account.  Fill  out   the template, and  be  sure   to tag  the  issue
appropriately using the input boxes below the main entry box.

== Feature Requests ==

The  Google  Code   issue  tracker  is  also  used   for  new  feature
requests. Use  the above guidelines  for bugs (i.e., look  for already
existing requests).  The only difference   between a bug report  and a
feature  request   is  that   a  feature  request   has  a   value  of
"Type-Enhancement" in the tag fields.
