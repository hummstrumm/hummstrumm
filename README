# Humm and Strumm Engine
To the extent possible under law, the people who associated CC0 with

## Overview
The Humm and Strumm Project is a Free, Open-Source Project to create a
high-performance, concurrent 3D video game engine in modern C++. The
Project is composed of volunteers from around the world. By creating a
foundation that we hope to be competitive with modern proprietary
video game engines and by licensing it under a copyleft Free Software
license, we hope to promote Free Software gaming. We actively test the
engine with popular compilers on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, and Microsoft
Windows, and it should compile and run on any POSIX system with X11
and OpenGL.

You can find our home page [here](http://hummstrumm.sourceforge.net).

Our home page has news updates, new downloads, documentation, and
links to all parts of the project.

## Features
  * Cross Platform: Our code is written in standards-compliant C++11,
    and should compile with any compiler that supports C++11. Our
    target compilers are Clang, GCC, and MSVC. We actively test on
    GNU/Linux, Windows, and FreeBSD, but we try to write our code so
    that it works on any system that supports X11 and POSIX.
  * Well-Documented: All code that is written for the Humm and Strumm
    Project must be well documented with Doxygen comments. We are also
    working on getting high-level guides and tutorials written.
  * Well-Tested: We have unit-tests for all our code that we run every
    nightly on all supported platforms, which helps us catch bugs that
    may have been missed during development.
  * Integration with C++11: Our code is modern C++, not Java-style OOP
    or C-style imperative code. We use the standard library and Boost
    heavily: our logging system integrates with the standard
    iostreams, we use `shared_ptr` and `unique_ptr` wherever it makes
    sense, and take advantage of the STL algorithms and data
    structures.

## System Requirements
We test our engine on x86 and x64_86 systems running Microsoft
Windows, GNU/Linux, and FreeBSD.  These platforms should have good
support.  (Please note that our FreeBSD code is new and experimental.)

In order to build the engine, you will need:

  * A C++11 compiler. We test the engine on MSVC 2013, GCC 4.8.2,
    Clang 3.3, and Clang 3.4. Any other compiler that supports C++11
    fully enough should work as well.
  * CMake 2.8 or later Build System
  * Eigen 3 Linear Algebra Library
  * Boost 1.33.0 or later Portable C++ Libraries
  * Intel TBB 4.2

To build and run unit tests, you will also need:

  * cipra 1.x Unit Testing Framework

To build API documentation, you will need:

  * Doxygen 1.8.2 or later
  * LaTeX (optional)

## Directory Structure
  * `src` - C++ source files
  * `include` - C++ header files.
  * `doc` - Doxygen documentation
  * `tests` - Test source files

## Installation
Please see the file `INSTALL` for instructions on how to install the
software.

## Release Notes
The file `NEWS` contains important changes that may affect the user of
the software.

## Credits
Please see the files `AUTHORS` and `THANKS` for all the people that
have helped make the Humm and Strumm engine possible.

## Bug Reports
The Humm and Strumm engine uses the Sourceforge issue tracking
system.  You can find out how to file a bug on the "Report a bug" [page
on our website](reportbug).
