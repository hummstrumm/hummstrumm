To save space, the Subversion repository SHOULD NOT contain the doxygen
documentation.  Do not commit the documentation to the repository!

If you want to view the documentation, please run generate-documentation.bat
or generate-documentation.bash in the trunk directory depending on your system.
You will need doxygen installed to do this.
