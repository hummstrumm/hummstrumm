Here are some of the Frequenly Asked Questions relating to the Humm and Strumm
game and software project.

Q: What is Humm and Strumm?
A: Humm and Strumm is a free 3D adventure game for PCs.  It uses it's own game
   engine, which runs on OpenGL, OpenAL, and several other FOSS libraries.  You
   play as Humm and Strumm, our two heros who must stop Dr. Geoff from taking
   over the world.

Q: Where can I find Humm and Strumm?
A: I'd suggest you look at our main website for information.  We are hosted by
   Google Code, and you can find us at <http://code.google.com/p/hummstrumm/>.
   There you will find links to the Google Groups, Blog, Deadline Calendar,
   Issue Tracker, Wiki, and more.

Q: How can I use Humm and Strumm?
A: Humm and Strumm is distributed under two licenses -- that is, one for the
   source code, and one for the other content (documentation, resources, et
   cetera).  The source code is distributed under the GNU GPL version 3 (or, at
   your option, later).  The content is distributed under a Creative Commons
   Attribution-ShareAlike Unported License 3.0.  You can use the software in
   any way you choose, as long as you do not break the terms of these licenses.

Q: What platforms does Humm and Strumm support?
A: Right now, it supports Win32, Win64, and GNU/Linux archetectures.
   See the minimum requirements in the README file for more information.

Q: Does that mean it won't work on my Mac (or other platform)?
A: It has never been tested on a Mac, but may work.  If the system is
   compatible with GNU/Linux, such as another UNIX variant with GNU tools, then
   it probably will work.  We do not gaurrantee this, however.  Please do not
   submit a bug about the game not running on unsupported platforms.

Q: Who Can Contribute?
A: The game is written by those listed in the AUTHORS file, and only they can
   commit to the Subversion repository.  Anyone can contribute by emailing one
   of the authors a change.  In doing this, you transfer all copyright of this
   change to the authors.  Please see
   <http://code.google.com/p/hummstrumm/wiki/Copyright> for more details.

Q: Does that mean I don't have access to the code?
A: No!  That would be violating the GPL!  Source code releases are available,
   and you can also anonymously check out the latest project source code using
   Subversion.

Q: The game doesn't seem to have many features yet.  Are more planned?
A: Yes.  Planned features can be found in our issue tracker and in the Roadmap.

Q: The game does not have very good graphics or music yet.  Are they planned?
A: Yes.  Better resources are one of the last things planned, however.  You
   will be able to enjoy full CGI cutscenes, though!

Q: Are there plans for a sequel?
A: One step at a time!  Yes, though, once the game engine is complete, it will
   be used for a sequel, too (perhaps a Go-Kart game?).

Q: Why play Humm and Strumm?
A: That's a good question...

Q: Can I be in the game?
A: No.

Q: Why'd you build your country store on a desert island?
A: Well, that's an easy one!  Because of the tourist traffic!  Except, there
   are no tourists... (Play through the game to understand the joke.)
