== Basic Installation ==

The most basic way to install the Humm and Strumm video game is to use
the  packages  available  for  download  on our  website.  We  provide
a Windows installer, and both Debian and RedHat packages.

=== Windows Installer ===

To  install  on  Windows,  download  the  latest  installer  from  the
downloads  page.   This installer  will  connect  to  the internet  to
download additional resources, and will alert you when it does.

*** TODO: Add specific installation instructions. ***

=== GNU/Linux Packages ===

The website also  has Debian and RedHat packages  for GNU/Linux users.
You  will need  to  install both  the  main package  and the  resource
package(s) to have the complete game.

*** TODO: Add specific installation instructions. ***

== Advanced Installation ==

If you are more of the hacker type, you can compile the game yourself.
We provide compressed archives of the source code and the resources.

To   compile,   you  will   need   CMake,   available   for  free   at
<http://www.cmake.org/>.

The basic installation commands for GNU systems are:

$ cmake -G "UNIX Makefiles"

$ sudo make install

For Windows systems, the sequence  varies depending on what you use to
compile  programs.  If  you  have  Microsoft NMake,  you  can use  the
following command:

$ cmake -G "NMake Makefiles"

$ nmake install

To  find out  what CMake  generators you  can use,  run  the following
command:

$ cmake --help

Running the installation command  will generate the engine library and
doxygen documentation files,  and then it will install  them onto your
system.  On  GNU systems,  this is by  default in  the ``/usr/local/''
directory,  and on  Windows systems,  it is  in the  ``Program Files''
directory.  You can change this by using the following command:

$ sudo make install DESTDIR="/some/absolute/path"
