# Humm and Strumm Engine Installation Instructions
To the extent possible under law, the people who associated CC0 with

We provide compressed archives of the source code and the resources.

To compile, you will need CMake, available for free at
[the CMake website](http://www.cmake.org/).

The basic instructions for generating build files are the same on all
systems.  If you run the following command, a set of build files that
can be used to build the Humm and Strumm Engine on your system will be
generated:

    $ cmake .

Then, you can build the engine using the build system installed on
your computer (usually make for GNU systems or nmake/MSVC++ for
Windows).

If you want to customize the package before you build it, you can use
the CMake cache, which contains build variables.  CMake comes with an
interactive mode, which allows you to configure these variables
yourself.  Run interactive mode with the following command:

    $ cmake -i .

You may also have the ncurses interface to CMake.

    $ ccmake .

Or the GUI interface to CMake.

    $ cmake-gui .

These will allow you to change the variables.  After this, you can
continue through the build platform.
