Basic Installation
======================================================================

The most basic way to install the Humm and Strumm video game is to use
the  packages  available  for  download  on our  website.  We  provide
a Windows installer, and both Debian and RedHat packages.


Windows Installer
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To  install  on  Windows,  download  the  latest  installer  from  the
downloads  page.   This installer  will  connect  to  the internet  to
download additional resources, and will alert you when it does.

TODO: Add specific installation instructions.


GNU/Linux Packages
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The website also  has Debian and RedHat packages  for GNU/Linux users.
You  will need  to  install both  the  main package  and the  resource
package(s) to have the complete game.

TODO: Add specific installation instructions.




Advanced Installation
======================================================================

If you are more of the hacker type, you can compile the game yourself.
We provide compressed archives of the source code and the resources.

To   compile,  you   will   need   CMake,  available   for   free   at
<http://www.cmake.org/>.

The basic instructions for generating  build files are the same on all
systems.  If you run the following  command, a set of build files that
can be used on your system will be generated:

  $ cmake .

Then, you can build the game  using the build system installed on your
computer (usually make for GNU systems or nmake/MSVC++ for Windows).

If you want to customise the  package before you build it, you can use
the CMake cache, which contains  build variables.  CMake comes with an
interactive  mode, which  allows   you to  configure  these  variables
yourself.  Run interactive mode with the following command:

  $ cmake -i .

You may also have the ncurses interface to CMake.

  $ ccmake .

Or the GUI interface to CMake.

  $ cmake-gui .

These will  allow you  to  change the  variables.  After this, you can
continue through the build platform.
