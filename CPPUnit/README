		    http://cppunit.sourceforge.net


CppUnit is the C++ port of the famous JUnit framework for unit
testing.

Bug reports are welcome.  Please use the SourceForge bug tracking
system at http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/.  Bugs that already
appear in the file BUGS do not need to be reported.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a modified version of CPPUnit using CMake that works on Windows.
Because we use an older version of CPPUnit for our testing, instead of the
newer and less stable version, we needed port this to recent versions of
Windows.  If your platform does not have packages for CPPUnit, then you can
use this version too, by editing the CMakeLists.txt file in the root of the
Humm and Strumm distribution (it's at the end of the file).
