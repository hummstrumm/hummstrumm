========================================

# Introduction                                              {#introduction}
This documentation describes the public API for the Humm and Strumm Engine.  It
is intended as a reference specification, not as a tutorial or user guide.  As
such, it does not document the high-level design of the Engine or provide a
guide for how to use the engine.

Humm and Strumm Project is a Free, Open-Source Project to create a
high-performance, concurrent 3D video game engine in modern C++. The Project is
composed of volunteers from around the world. By creating a foundation that we
hope to be competitive with modern proprietary video game engines and by
licensing it under a copyleft Free Software license, we hope to promote Free
Software gaming. We actively test the engine with popular compilers on
GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, and Microsoft Windows, and it should compile and run on any
POSIX system with X11 and OpenGL.

This documentation was automatically generated by the
[Doxygen](http://doxygen.org) tool.

# Using This API Reference                                  {#using}
This documentation is intended to give a comprehensive specification for the
Humm and Strumm Engine's API.  It is not suited to learning how to use that API
from the ground up.  It should instead be used as a reference for the behavior
of each part of the API.

A list of conventions that are used in this documentation can be found on the
@ref conventions page.  It is recommended that you read that page before
continuing on.
